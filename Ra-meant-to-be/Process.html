							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p style="margin: 5%; margin-bottom: 0%;";>
								Our electrical system involves two power sources, a single Arduino Mega, 
								a secondary Arduino Uno for extra power, one STSPIN820 stepper motor driver, 
								one stepper motor, six servo motors, two vibration motors, one LCD display, 
								a temperature sensing probe, the COTS Hotplate PCB, and multiple buttons.

								<h3>Goals: Is this Possible? </h3>
								<p>
									Powder and noodle dispensing, and controlling the hotplate
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Design:</b> We used sprint 1 as a proof of concept for our MVP components. 
									We chose to focus on boiling the water, and adding noodles and powder to the 
									bowl. As a reach, we also wanted to use a temperature sensor to detect when the 
									water was boiling. 
									<ul>
										<li>Mechanical: Create a single noodle dispenser and powder dispenser.</li>
										<li>Electrical: Interact with the hotplate to turn it on and off and connect the temperature sensor.</li>
										<li>Software: Control the servos for all of the components, and read the temperature sensor</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Conclusion:</b> We can move the minimum necessary components into our bowl, and boil the bowl of 
									ramen! It is super unstable and definitely not food safe at all. 
								</p>

								<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sprint 2</h2>

								<h3>Goals: Can We Make Things More Food Safe?</h3>
								<p>
									Multiple noodle and powder servings, water dispensing, and a user interface
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Design:</b> We wanted to create a more stable frame for all of our components to live on, and chose to use 
									8020 as it was easy to use and move components about. 
									<ul>
										<li>Mechanical: Created dispensers to hold multiple noodle and powder servings, Added version 1 of the water dispenser.</li>
										<li>Electrical: Created a user interface with LCD screens and buttons. </li>
										<li>Software: Tested the text to order function, made the code modular for testing. </li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Conclusion:</b> We need to combine all of these components, and fully test the noodle, powder, and water dispensers. 
								</p>

								<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sprint 3</h2>

								<h3>Goals: Polish and Integrate</h3>
								<p>
									Organized and mounted everything to a final position in the frame, worked on making things more consistent, and made RAMEN!!!!
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Design:</b> We wanted to finalize positions and materials, and focus on integration, as our components worked as individuals, 
									but we were unable to test a full runthrough until we switched to an Arduino Mega which arrived at the start of this sprint. 
									<ul>
										<li>Mechanical: Multi noodle dispenser, powder dispenser, and water dispenser were fully tested and iterated, so the final versions were implemented</li>
										<li>Electrical: Mounted components in a safe and stable way, cleaned up wiring to be easier to troubleshoot, integrated individual components onto
											 one Arduino Mega. We ran into a few power issues as we have many components on our board, but those were resolved.  </li>
										<li>Software: The wireless shield for the text to order function shorted, so we moved to polishing the code to make 
											it easier to test and integrate. </li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Conclusion:</b> While text to order doesn’t work, we can successfully make ramen, and the bot as a whole is easy to troubleshoot as the components are organized.
