								<h1>About Us</h1>
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/team.jpeg" alt="" height="500" /></p>
								<p>We are a group of engineering students from Olin College of Engineering, located in Needham, MA. From left to right in the picture, we have: Karen Hinh, Jules Brettle, Jong Ho Lee, Sydney Chung, and Kelly Yen.</p>
								<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:row">
									<p style="padding-right: 1.5rem"><b>Karen Hinh</b> hails from Paris, France. She is a mechanical engineering major, and designed the drivetrain for Wall-E while supporting other fabrication and assembly tasks.
										When not found in her bed on Youtube, she is likely thinking about food or finding the next place to go eat. She loves the outdoors and is deeply invested in sustainability.</p>
									<p style="padding-right: 1.5rem"><b>Jules Brettle</b> is a E:Robotics major from the SF Bay Area. She focused on the servo control and BPM-matching code, and took most of the photos featured on this site. In her free time, she can be found watching the Star Trek spinoff shows and playing with her dog. </p>
									<p style="padding-right: 1.5rem"><b>Jong Ho Lee</b> is a Mech:E major from Seoul, South Korea. For this project, he shifted his focus away from purely mechanical subsystems, and leaned more towards integration/electrical. Specifically, he designed the power system and assisted the mechanical team assemble Wall-E. Besides riding his bike through the streets of the city, he likes to spend time watching anime and drinking hot chocolate. :)</p>
									<p style="padding-right: 1.5rem"><b>Sydney Chung</b> is a Mech:E major from Claremont, CA. She focused on mechanical design & fabrication of Wall-E’s arms and body, as well as integration for this project. If she isn’t sleeping or eating, she’s definitely daydreaming about boba, watching Netflix or anime, rewatching Spiderman movies, or playing guitar.</p>
									<p><b>Kelly Yen</b> is an ECE major from Redmond, WA. She focused on developing software and integrating electronics for Wall-E, particularly motor control and audio processing. She was also our amazing PM! When not working on PIE, she can be found eating good asian food and PM-ing for PiNT.</p>
