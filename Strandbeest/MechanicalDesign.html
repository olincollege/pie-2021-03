								<p>The leg design is based on Jansen's linkage, a linkage design made by 
									Theo Jansen for his Strandbeest sculptures. The legs needed to transfer 
									the rotation of the motor shaft into a stepping motion. The initial design 
									(shown right) was made to replicate the motion of the Jansen linkage. 
									Assuming we would need to make small adjustments, the first iteration of the 
									linkages were designed with future modification in mind; each linkage contains 
									bolt holes at 1 cm intervals to make small changes very easy. This ended up causing 
									strength problems within the part so after the final lengths were determined the 
									design shifted to solid parts (shown left) in the second iteration. The other change 
									between the two designs are the modified linkage lengths. While the initial design 
									was optimized for the step pattern, the second iteration was designed for simplicity 
									while keeping a step pattern that would work on the robot. This simplification led 
									to using five 9 unit linkages making construction much easier. </p>

								<h2>Material Choice</h2>
							</header>
							
							<article class="box post">
							<p>The first iteration of the legs used 3d printed linkages made of PLA printer filament. 
								This material was chosen because it’s a readily available prototyping material that our 
								team had experience using. The material proved to have too much friction for the motors 
								we were using, causing the legs to bind. In addition the print time for each leg was 
								roughly 5 hours, and printing 8 legs for the final design would have been a challenge. </p> 
							<p>We decided to move to ⅛th inch laser cut acrylic for the second iteration. This allowed 
								us to cut all 8 legs on one sheet, reducing the manufacturing time significantly. The 
								acrylic also proved to have lower friction than the PLA, and when combined with the 
								higher torque motors we purchased (this is explained under motor selection) this solved 
								the friction problem. However, the new motors increased the weight of the robot and the 
								acrylic was not strong enough to counter the mass increase. The legs bent, and would not 
								function properly when holding the full robot. To solve this we increase the ⅛th inch 
								acrylic to ¼th inch acrylic. While there's still some bend in the legs, they are functional 
								and are unlikely to break.

											Another factor that helped the bending problem was the addition of 3d printed feet. 
											We made feet for each leg that prevented them from sliding to the side (shown Right). 
											Initially the feet were just plastic, however on the tile floor the robot is designed 
											to walk on, they couldn’t get enough traction to actually move the robot forward.

							To solve the traction problem we added rubber bands to the pads of the feet. But the bending of 
							the legs meant that the feet would drag while trying to move forward. The solution was to make 
							feet that only had friction in one direction, pulling the robot forward then sliding back into 
							position. This was accomplished by putting the rubber bands on an angle, and adding a layer of 
							tape to the top. This means when the foot is moving forward the foot slides along the tape, and 
							when it is moving back the angled rubber catches the ground pulling the robot forward.

							Leg linkage mounts consist of 2 hardboard plates held together by PLA brackets which 
							attach the leg linkages to the main chassis box. Leg mounts contain a space for the linkage’s 
							fixed axle and a secondary space for the axle which powers the linkage, either directly from 
							the motor shaft or through the offset system. 3 leg mounts hold motors, while 2 hold the 
							offset axles of back legs in place. Leg mounts are attached to hardboard plates at the top and 
							bottom, forming the central chassis box.

									<p>The chassis box is the main body of the robot, and holds the Arduino and motor shield,

									arduino, batteries and cables are all stored in spaces formed by the leg mounts to conceal 
									them and give the robot a tidier appearance. The Raspi is secured under the main body to 
									lower the center of mass and make the robot more stable, while the camera is mounted on top.</p>
									
									<p>The chassis plate is designed with slots at the leg mounting points. These slots allow the motor 
										mounts to be slid along the chassis plate then re-tightened for on-the-fly repositioning of the 
										legs-motor components. </p>

							<p>The chassis plates were made of hardboard such that holes could easily be drilled in the plate to 
								reposition fastening points for the RasPi and camera, which are held outside the main chassis box. 
								Hardboard is also a fairly rigid material, which (especially configured in the box shape of the 
								chassis center) will resist bending under the weight of the motors electronics.</p>

						<p>The primary factor in choosing motors was the torque, and speed was secondary. Our original motors 
							were rated at 1.5 kg cm of torque with a speed of 200 rpm. After encountering issues with stalling, 
							we selected motors rated at 7 kg cm of torque, 4.5 times higher than the original motors. Though the 
							motors were heavier and the speed was much slower at 60 rpm. The speed is not a problem for the 
							functionality of the robot, however, because of the friction decrease in the linkages, a higher speed 
							lower torque motor would have been sufficient. The increased mass did prove to be a problem as 
							explained in the section on material choice for leg design.  </p>

						<p>The legs all had to be driven by an offset axle because the movement of some of the linkages would 
							interfere with a traditional axle. To address this with the front legs we chose motors that had an 
							axle coming out of either side so the motor could be placed between the two legs to eliminate this 
							interference. A 3D printed part was used to turn the rotation of the motor shaft into an offset axle 
							movement to drive the legs. Each side was rotated 180 degrees from the other so the legs in the pair 
							are in opposite positions from each other at all times. The motor shaft mount CAD is shown below as 
							well as images of the assembled connection between the motor and front legs.</p>

										<p>For the set of back legs, all 4 legs are driven off of the same motor. To accommodate for 
											this, we designed an extra part to act as an extension of the offset axle and transfer 
											movement from the inner legs which were driven by the motor to the outer legs. It splits 
											in half so that it can be inserted into the chassis panels that support it and has concealed 
											teeth to lock the two sides at an offset angle. While the teeth themselves are not particularly 
											strong in a 3D printed part, once they are held together with a bolt that runs through the 
											center of the part as shown below they are adequately strong to not shear off and make the 
											sides start slipping when the torques of the legs are applied to them.
										</p>
										<p>	The star pattern has 6 teeth because this allows for the angle between the two sides 
											to be changed to any increment of 30 degrees. Strandbeest mechanisms that we referenced 
											commonly had the legs offset from each other at 120 degree angles, but our front legs 
											are based on a 180 degree offset because there are only 2 legs in the set. To account 
											for this the part is designed to be able to easily switch angles so we could test 
											different offsets. We ended up finding that a 180 degree offset worked the best because 
											it meant 2 of the 4 back legs would touch the ground at the same time in each leg stroke 
											which helped with stability.
