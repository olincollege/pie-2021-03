									<h2>Sprint 3</h2>
									<a href="images/sprint3/movingBelt.gif" class="image centered-small-extra"><img src="images/sprint3/movingBelt.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In Sprint 3, we wanted to finish designing and fabricating all mechanical parts, finalize the timing of the chain (stepper motor) and cams (servo motors), assemble all parts to as close to the final version as possible in the time frame available.</p>
								</header>

								<h3>Mechanical</h3>
								<h4>Cells</h4>
								<p>Since the cell design was finalized through many iterations in Sprint 2, all that was left to do in Sprint 3 was 3D print the cells to form the chain. We used 32 cells total, and formed the chain by connecting the cells with pins. Of those 32 cells, we had two types: a "live" cell and a "blank cell." A live cell was a full cell with all of the braille pins. A blank cell was made up of two separate pieces that would fill in the gap in the chain on both sides. We used a total of 28 live cells and 4 blank cells. The purpose of the blank cells was to allow us to more easily reach parts deeper in the housing. </p>

								<h4>Pins</h4>
								<p>Having tested the pins in sprint 2, we ordered more for the final version. When we put the pins in the cells, some fit the holes perfectly. Unfortunately, some of holes were too big and the pins were falling through the holes, or the holes were too small and the pins were difficult to press up or down. We suspect this inconsistency was a result of the 3D print tolerances. For the holes that were slightly too large, we put tape around the pin until it fit properly in the hole. We decided on this solution based on what we could do quickly in the time remaining in the project. For the holes that were slightly too small, we used a small circular file to remove some material and make the hole a bit larger.</p>


								<h3>Electrical</h3>
								<p>In Sprint 3, we made a few improvements to our circuit and user interaction and then transferred the circuit to a solder-able protoboard. To power on and off the system and both power sources, we use a double pole single throw (DPST) switch. This allows us to easily turn on and off both power rails (the 5V for the Arduino and the 12V for the stepper motor). We also added a slide switch to control the grade of braille. The final circuit and the physical controls are shown below.</p>

								<h3>Software/Firmware</h3>
								<p>During Sprint 3, we refined our driver code and calibrated the cam/stepper motor system. As we designed our control mechanism at the end of Sprint 3 and built a skeleton, all we had to do was determine constant values. We measured the number of microsteps to move from one cell to the next. We also determined the positions for the servos to actuate the pins. This was a lot of trial and error, as each servo needed slightly different values to activate the pins. After this, we had a fully integrated system that was able to create braille cells!</p>

								<h4>Timing</h4>
								<p>Instead of having cell chain move continuously and coordinating the cams to activate the pins while the chain was moving, we decided to instead sequence these actions.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Belt moves to align the cell with the cam</li>
									<li>Cams move to the right position to actuate the pins included in the current braille letter being printed</li>
									<li>Once the pins have been pushed up, the belt moves again to move to the next cell</li>
									<li>Repeat</li>
								</ol>

								<h4>GUI</h4>
								<p>The GUI was completed in Sprint 2.</p>

								<h4>Switches</h4>
								<p>We integrated the braille 1 and braille 2 switch code with the Arduino.</p>
