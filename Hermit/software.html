											<h3>PIR sensing, PID, and differential drive</h3>
											<p>
												We use two PIR sensors to determine the location of a person. 
												These are HC-SR501 PIR motion detectors, which output a digital 
												HIGH or LOW depending on whether the sensor detects a difference 
												in infrared between the left and right halves of the sensor. See 
												electrical documentation for additional information.
											</p>
											<p>
												The PIR outputs are fed into a PID loop based on the outputs of the 
												left and right sensors, using similar logic as the mini-project 3 
												PID loop. The left and right motors are driven forward at differential 
												rates depending on the output of the PID loop calculated based on the 
												PIR sensors towards the person. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/
												berwinlan/PIE-FinalProject/blob/627d632a281256b5cc868ad0cf744b052ecac3ca/pid/
												pid.ino">the source code</a> for further detail.
											</p>
											<p>
												For human sensing, we chose to use PIR sensing instead of a more advanced system 
												(i.e., OpenCV) for two primary reasons. The first was the overhead cost associated 
												with the hardware necessary for computer vision, such as a more powerful 
												microcontroller and potentially an on-board camera. Secondly, the limited 
												number of software people-hours (one E:C) and our goals to have multiple 
												functioning software systems meant that it made more sense to choose a simpler, 
												more straightforward human sensing system in the interest of other mechanisms.

											<h3>Phototransistor and head movement</h3>
											<p>
												We use one HW5P-1 phototransistor to determine whether the hermit crab is upright or 
												upside down. As discussed in the electrical documentation, the phototransistor outputs 
												to a pin on the microcontroller depending on how much light is present. It is mounted 
												on the bottom of the base plate, facing toward the ground. Thus, when the hermit crab 
												is upright, the phototransistor is shadowed, and it outputs below our threshold. When 
												the hermit crab is lifted or upside down, the phototransistor senses the increase in 
												light above our threshold. The logical comparison between the phototransistor’s moving 
												average and light threshold is done by the software on the Arduino.
											</p>
											<p>
												The threshold was chosen so that when any light reached the phototransistor, the threshold 
												would be exceeded. We encountered a roadblock where noise from the phototransistor would 
												inadvertently trigger the head to retract and extend, which was easily fixed by taking a 
												moving average of the phototransistor readings (with the movingAvg library) to use for 
												the logical comparison to the threshold.
											</p>
											<p>
												A servo is used for the head slot-slider mechanism. The servo has two states, one for head 
												in and one for head out (at 0 and 180 degree positions). Based on the phototransistor output 
												and the current state of the head, the Arduino writes to the servo to flip the state of the head.
											</p>
											<p>
												We chose to use a phototransistor instead of a more complex orientation sensor for simplicity. 
												Because we placed the phototransistor in a location where it would always be shadowed in the 
												upright orientation, we were able to add logic in software that mapped the phototransistor 
												output to the orientation of the hermit crab.
