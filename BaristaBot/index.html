							<h2 class="major">About</h2>
							<p>The BaristaBot 2.0 is a coffee-making robot that shows the beauty in the process of making a cup of coffee. 
								The BaristaBot2.0 is a new take on the original <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/2018/flair_barista/index.html" target="_blank" >BaristaBot, 
								</a>which aimed to fully automate the coffee brewing process with an assembly-line-style aesthetic.</p>
							<p>For our iteration, we decided to aim for an open-view, more compact experience that not only dispenses coffee, 
								but the additional capability to add milk and sugar.</p>

						<!-- Mechanical Subsystem -->
							<article id="mechanical">
								<h2 class="major">Mechanical</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Here you can see the mechanical design of the BaristaBot2.0 from the 
									heating water container, bean grinder, ingredient dispensing, and the cup stirrer.
								</p>
								<h3>Bean Grinder</h3>
								<!-- Schematic goes here -->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>When seeing how the original BaristaBot team implemented bean grinding, we tried to 
									create a unique solution. When that did not work, we traced back our steps and 
									attempted to recreate their solution which was put take a hand bean grinder and 
									attach a strong 12V DC motor to it. We acquired a hand grinder and stripped it so 
									that it would fit out purpose.
									
									Later, we harvested a motor from an old cordless hand drill that had a bad battery
									as we had tried to grind beans with a smaller 5V DC motor but that failed. Still,
									as great as the larger 12V bean grinding motor was, it posed many issues for both
									the mechanical and electrical teams. On the mechanical side, it was quite bulky, 
									heavy, and had a planetary transmission that we had to keep. If we had not kept it,
									we would not have been able to connect the shaft of the bean grinder to the chuck of 
									the drill. We would have had to make out own coupling to connect them and that was 
									deemed not worth the time. After CADing a mount for both the grinder and the motor,
									we connected the two using wooden dowels to constrain the torqy movement of the motor.

									For as much as we wanted to have this in the final iteration, we could not keep it in
									due to complications in the electrical components needed to power the motor as it 
									ran at a variable amperage that bounced from 3.5A to 4.8A thus making it difficult to 
									build a circuit for, especially when we were already doing a complicated one for the
									water heating elements.
								</p>
								<h3>Ingredient Dispensers</h3>
								<!-- Schematic goes here -->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Having had experience with the creation of food safe containers, our team opted to purchase
									COTS dispensing containers from Amazon. The containers were originally intended to be used
									with cereal, so adjusting them to work with finer ingredients was something that we knew would
									have to be addressed. Our solution to that ended up being putting tape on the "flippers". This
									would then make the gap between the flippers and the sidewalls of the containers small enough
									to limit the amount of spillage. The ingredients we were putting inside these containers were 
									bean grinds, powdered creamer, and granulated sugar.

									These COTS containers were perfect for our team in the sense that we were able to quickly and 
									easily motorize them. We simply took the handle that had a D-shaft attached to it (which 
									attached to the flippers), sanded it flat, and put a servo mount that was available to us in 
									the PIE room. Just like that, we now had motorized dispensers. 

									For more on how these were mounted in the system, read the section on the Box housing/tiered system.
								</p>
								<h3>Cup Stirrer</h3>
								<!-- Schematic goes here -->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>And finally, when all the coffee ingredients are in the cup, the mixer will automatically mix the cup for the user.</p>
							</article>

						<!-- Electrical -->
							<article id="electrical">
								<h2 class="major">Electrical</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/barista_bot_electrical_full.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Electrical System is composed of multiple modules defined by the Arduinos that drives the coffee machine 
									from water heating, coffee bean grinding, ingredient dispensing, and cup stirring.</p>		
								<h3>A. Water Heating</h3>
								<h3>B. Water Dispensing</h3>
								<h3>C. Ingredient Dispensing</h3>
								<p>The powdered milk and sugar ingredients are dispensed using containers and a dispensing mechanism controlled by a servo.
									When the ingredient needs to be dispensed, the servo rotates, dropping in some sugar and milk into the cup.
								</p>
								<h3>D. Cup Rotating</h3>
								<p>When alternating between the coffee brewer, ingredient dispensers, and cup stirrer, 
									the surface where the cup is held rotates with a servo that is placed underneath each dispenser.
								</p>
								<h3>E. Cup Stirring</h3>
								<p>
									As the final step to mix the ingredients together, the mechanism has a actuator that is lowered into a cup by a servo
									which has a 5V motor attached to the end of it. This motor spins the rod attached to its shaft that stirs the contents in the cup.
								</p>

						<!-- Software -->
						<article id="software">
							<h2 class="major">Software</h2>
							<p>At a high level, the firmware help facilitates all the functions within the electrical components of the BaristaBot.</p>
							<p>The image provides an overivew of the streamline process that occurs when the ingredients are poured into the machine,
								to the machine brewing the coffee into a cup.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/software_arch.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The system starts when the user whether or not they want sugar or milk in their coffee.
								Depending on what the user chooses, the machine will dispense the sugar and/or milk into the cup alongside the brewed coffee with hot water and beans.
								When all the ingredients are put in the cup, then the stirring mechanism will mix the ingredients together
								with the final product of a fresh, hot cup of coffee.
